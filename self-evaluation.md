# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    Decently confident. A simple loops that goes through each value in an array.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    I felt confident enough! It was easier than ever to find the documentation I needed whether for nmethods or other techniques thanks to those tips of how to properly word a question!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    Dedicate some timne to better memorize some commands, otherwise I don't think there's much else.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    Unsure at the moment, I feel like I'm learning things at the appropriate pace.
